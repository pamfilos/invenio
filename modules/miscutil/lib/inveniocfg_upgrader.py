Invenio upgrade engine.

Recommendations for writing upgrades
------------------------------------

 * An upgrade must be self-contained. DO NOT IMPORT ANYTHING from Invenio
   unless absolutely necessary. Reasons: 1) If a it depends on other Invenio
   modules, then their API must be very stable and backwards-compatible.
   Otherwise when an upgrade is applied two years later, the Invenio function
   might have evolved and the upgrade will fail. 2) Furthermore upgrades are
   *LOADED BEFORE* actually being installed into site-packages  (e.g. when
   "make check-upgrade" are being run). This means that an upgrade cannot
   assume anything about which version of Invenio is installed, and thus if
   the imported module is available or not.
 * Once an upgrade have been committed to master/maint, no fiddling is allowed
   afterwards. If you want to correct a mistake, make an new upgrade instead.
 * All upgrades must depend on a previous upgrade (except for your first
   upgrade).
 * For every software release, make a '<repository>_release_<x>_<y>_<z>.py' that
   depends on all upgrades between the previous release and the new, so
   future upgrades can depend on this upgrade. The command
   --upgrade-create-release-recipe can help you with this.
 * Upgrades may query for user input, but must be able to run in unattended
   mode when --yes-i-know option is being used, thus good defaults/guessing
   should be used.

Upgrade dependency graph
------------------------
The upgrades form a *dependency graph* that must be without cycles (i.e.
a DAG). The upgrade engine supports having several independent graphs (you
normally want one graph for Invenio and one for your overlay). The graphs are
defined using via a filename prefix using the pattern
(<repository>_<date>_<name>.py).

The upgrade engine will run upgrades in topological order (i.e upgrades
will be run respecting the dependency graph). The engine will detect cycles in
the graph and will refuse to run any upgrades until the cycles have been
broken.

Upgrade modules
---------------
Upgrades are implemented as normal Python modules. They must implement the
methods do_upgrade() and info() and contain a list variable 'depends_on'.
Optionally they may implement the methods estimate(), pre_upgrade(),
post_upgrade().

The upgrade engine expects that Invenio upgrades are located in
in $(top_srcdir)/modules/miscutil/lib/upgrades/ and
CFG_PREFIX/lib/python/invenio/upgrades/ respectively.

An upgrade can only depend on upgrades in the same repository (i.e. same graph).

A note on upgrade pre-checks prior to installation
----------------------------------------------------
An important feature of the upgrade engine is the ability to run upgrade
pre-checks prior to actually being installed into site-packages. This allows
a system administrator to validate the upgrades prior to running make install,
where it would be too late to discover issues and roll-back.

This means that upgrades cannot assume anything about loaded Invenio modules.
E.g. the following import::

  from invenio.pluginutils import create_enhanced_plugin_builder

will fail on 1.0.0 while it works on 1.1.0. If the above import statement is
put at the module-level (which you would normally do), the upgrade will never
be loaded when the user is on 1.0.0 and the entire upgrade process will most
likely fail. If on the other hand, the import is put in the pre-check function,
the upgrade will be loaded, but the pre-check will fail and the user will be
properly notified.
